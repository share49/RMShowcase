# RMShowcase

## Intro

This showcase project gets the Rick and Morty characters from rickandmortyapi.com and shows a view with all the information of the selected character.

## Technical considerations for scalability

- I created Request as a middle layer to have flexibility to customize requests, either by adding headers or extra parameters.
- Although ResponseErrorHelper only returns an error message, it's designed to be extensible to localize error messages, parse error codes, or provide additional information.

## Contributing

- `!` Fix for a bug or issue
